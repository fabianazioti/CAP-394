##### Final Work

Time series analysis plays an increasingly important role in many applications. It is possible to analyze the behavior of an object over time and to estimate future behavior. Some examples include: natural phenomena such as temperature, land use and land cover, etc.

The data visualization is an important tool to analyze the time series in order to understand more efficiently the behavior of different phenomena. Line charts are a type of visualization that is widely used for this purpose. However, as data collected by various devices in a wide range of applications increases, the existing tools for time-series visualization may not be sufficient.

In view of this context the objective of the work is presented: **Time Series Visualization**
